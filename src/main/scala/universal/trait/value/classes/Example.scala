    * A ''universal trait'' is a trait that extends `Any`, only has `def`s as members, and does no initialization.
    *
    * The main use case for universal traits is to allow basic inheritance of methods for [[scala.AnyVal value classes]].
    * For example,
    *
    * {{{
    *     trait Printable extends Any {
    *       def print(): Unit = println(this)
    *     }
    *     class Wrapper(val underlying: Int) extends AnyVal with Printable
    *
    *     val w = new Wrapper(3)
    *     w.print()
    * }}}
    *

  /** Source - http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html

    * Value classes are a new mechanism in Scala to avoid allocating runtime
    * objects. This is accomplished through the definition of new AnyVal subclasses
    *

  /**
    * Use Cases:
    *
    * 1. Extension Methods - combine them with implicit classes (SIP-13) for allocation-free extension methods
    * Using an implicit class provides a more convenient syntax for defining extension methods, while value
    * classes remove the runtime overhead
    * - BASICALLY -
    * Allows you to create implicit extension methods equivalent to that of Static Methods(no instance required)
    *
    * 2. Correctness - get the type safety of a data type without the runtime allocation overhead
    * Example:
